mini_proj2: Prediction and Classification

This is the Mini Project 2 Information. There are few files in this FOLDER, an 18-minute presentation slide Deck which is targeted towards medium-level Audience. Two co-lab *.ipynb files, which explain the step-by-step process of execution of PREDICTION of housing Value in California, and CLASSIFICATION of stroke data. one results.pickle file which stores the best result of the prediction problem (Problem1). There are many models in both PREDICTION and CLASSIFICATION problems, so all these pickle files will add to the complexity of the code. So only one pickle file is created for a best result of prediction problem. 

Details: 
Problem 1: To build a Regression Model to Predict the "median_house_value in California

Problem Statement: Exploring Available Data related to housing in California for (1) Insights, and (2) Predicting House Value.


Solution: Applying Machine Learning Algorithms such as Univariant, and Multi Variant linear Regression with  Regularization.
(https://github.com/venuannamdas/mini_proj2/blob/master/2_1.ipynb) 

Estimate 
         
         (a)  median_house_value using 

         (b) several independent variables, and finally, 
         
         (c) draw a ‘Value prediction/Regression line’ 
         

Problem 2: Build a classification model to predict stroke (= 1/0)


Problem Statement: Exploring Available Data related to stroke for classification as (a) stroke (=1) (b) no stroke (=0) (c) Data Insights, and (d)convergence 

Solution: Application of six Machine Learning Algorithms/strategies such as  
(https://github.com/venuannamdas/mini_proj2/blob/master/2_2.ipynb )

    (1) logistic regression 
    
    (2) logistic regression-Regularization. 
    
    (3) Support Vector Machine, 
    
    (4) SVM-Hyper tuned 
    
    (5) KNN 
    
    (6) KNN-with cross-validation. 
    

Additionally, to handle unbalanced, employed class weights and Minority-Over Sampling was adopted. Finally, Target Variable i.e. stroke regression results are obtained
