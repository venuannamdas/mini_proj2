mini_proj2: Prediction and Classification

This is Mini Project 2 Information file. There are 3 files in this FOLDER, an 18 minutes presentation slide Deck which is targeted towards medium-level Audience. Two co-lab *.ipynb files, which explain step by step process of  execution of PREDICTION of housing Value in California, and CLASSIFICATION of stroke data. 

Details: 
Problem 1: To build a Regression Model to Predict the "median_house_value in California

Problem Statement: Exploring Available Data related to housing in California for (1) Insights, and (2) Predicting House Value.


Solution: Applying Machine Learning Algorithms such as Univariant, and Multi Variant linear Regression with  Regularization.
(https://github.com/venuannamdas/mini_proj2/blob/master/2_1.ipynb) 

Estimate 
         
         (a)  median_house_value using 

         (b) several independent variables, and finally, 
         
         (c) draw a ‘Value prediction/Regression line’ 
         

Problem 2: Build a classification model to predict stroke (= 1/0)


Problem Statement: Exploring Available Data related to stroke for classification as (a) stroke (=1) (b) no stroke (=0) (c) Data Insights, and (d)convergence 

Solution: Application of six Machine Learning Algorithms/strategies such as  
(https://github.com/venuannamdas/mini_proj2/blob/master/2_2.ipynb )

    (1) logistic regression 
    
    (2) logistic regression-Regularization. 
    
    (3) Support Vector Machine, 
    
    (4) SVM-Hyper tuned 
    
    (5) KNN 
    
    (6) KNN-with cross-validation. 
    

Additionally, to handle unbalanced, employed class weights and Minority-Over Sampling was adopted. Finally, Target Variable i.e. stroke regression results are obtained
